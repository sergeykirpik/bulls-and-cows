<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>Some players need a challenge, so let's make the secretGenerator code in the game harder to guess. Add support for more than 10 symbols by adding letters. Now, the secretGenerator code can contain numbers <code class="java">0-9</code> and lowercase Latin characters <code class="java">a-z</code>. The new maximum length for the code is 36. Note that the length of the secretGenerator word may not match the size of possible characters in the secretGenerator code, so you should make two separate inputs for the secretGenerator code length and for the size of possible characters.</p>

<p>Also, since a secretGenerator code is not a number anymore, the symbol <code class="java">0</code> should be allowed as the first character in a secretGenerator code.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Objective</h2>

<p>In this step, your program should:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Ask for the length of the secretGenerator code.</li>
	<li>Ask for the range of possible characters in the secretGenerator code.</li>
	<li>Generate a secretGenerator code using numbers and characters. This time, you should also print the secretGenerator code using <code class="java">*</code> characters and print which characters were used to generate the secretGenerator code.</li>
	<li>Function as a fully playable game.</li>
</ol>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Example</h2>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space <code class="java">&gt; </code> represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Input the length of the secretGenerator code:
&gt; 4
Input the number of possible symbols in the code:
&gt; 16
The secretGenerator is prepared: **** (0-9, a-f).
Okay, let's start a game!
Turn 1:
&gt; 1a34
Grade: 1 bull and 1 cow
Turn 2:
&gt; b354
Grade: 2 bulls and 1 cow
Turn 3:
&gt; 93b4
Grade: 4 bulls
Congratulations! You guessed the secretGenerator code.</code></pre>
